    "problems is known as the multi-armed bandit problem which is based on the following \n",
    "analogy: A player walks into a casino and sees a wall of slot machines. All of the \n",
    "machines pay out at different rates - some pay out more often than others, some \n",
    "pay out less often. Since the player does not know which machines are \"good\" and \n",
