    "## Hot Hands\n",
    "\n",
    "Basketball players who make several baskets in succession are described as \n",
    "having a *hot hand*. Fans and players have long believed in the hot hand \n",
    "phenomenon, which refutes the assumption that each shot is independent of the \n",
    "next. However, [a 1985 paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028585900106) by Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky collected evidence\n",
    "that contradicted this belief and showed that successive shots are independent \n",
    "events. This paper started a great controversy that continues to this day, as you can \n",
    "see by Googling *hot hand basketball*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not expect to resolve this controversy today. However, in this lab we'll \n",
    "apply one approach to answering questions like this. The goals for this lab are \n",
    "to (1) think about the effects of independent and dependent events, (2) learn \n",
    "how to simulate shooting streaks in R, and (3) to compare a simulation to actual\n",

    "<ol>\n",
    "<li> The distribution of Kobe's streaks is unimodal and right skewed. </li>\n",
    "<li> The typical length of a streak is 0 since the median of the distribution is at 0. </li>\n",
    "<li> The IQR of the distribution is 1. \n",
    "<li> The longest streak of baskets is of length 4. </li>\n",
    "<li> The shortest streak is of length 1.</li>\n",

    "\n",
    "## Compared to What?\n",
    "\n",
    "We've shown that Kobe had some long shooting streaks, but are they long enough \n",
    "to support the belief that he had hot hands? What can we compare them to?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, let's return to the idea of *independence*. Two \n",
    "processes are independent if the outcome of one process doesn't effect the outcome \n",
    "of the second. If each shot that a player takes is an independent process, \n",
    "having made or missed your first shot will not affect the probability that you\n",
    "will make or miss your second shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "A shooter with a hot hand will have shots that are *not* independent of one \n",
    "another. Specifically, if the shooter makes his first shot, the hot hand model \n",
    "says he will have a *higher* probability of making his second shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's suppose for a moment that the hot hand model is valid for Kobe. During his\n",
    "career, the percentage of time Kobe makes a basket (i.e. his shooting \n",
    "percentage) is about 45%, or in probability notation,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(\\textrm{shot 1 = H}) = 0.45 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "If he makes the first shot and has a hot hand (*not* independent shots), then \n",
    "the probability that he makes his second shot would go up to, let's say, 60%,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(\\textrm{shot 2 = H} \\, | \\, \\textrm{shot 1 = H}) = 0.60 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of these increased probabilites, you'd expect Kobe to have longer \n",
    "streaks. Compare this to the skeptical perspective where Kobe does *not* have a\n",
    "hot hand, where each shot is independent of the next. If he hit his first shot,\n",
    "the probability that he makes the second is still 0.45.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(\\textrm{shot 2 = H} \\, | \\, \\textrm{shot 1 = H}) = 0.45 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, making the first shot did nothing to effect the probability that\n",
    "he'd make his second shot. If Kobe's shots are independent, then he'd have the \n",
    "same probability of hitting every shot regardless of his past shots: 45%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've phrased the situation in terms of independent shots, let's return\n",
    "to the question: how do we tell if Kobe's shooting streaks are long enough to \n",
    "indicate that he has hot hands? We can compare his streak lengths to someone\n",
    "without hot hands: an independent shooter. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulations in R\n",
    "\n",
    "While we don't have any data from a shooter we know to have independent shots, \n",
    "that sort of data is very easy to simulate in R. In a simulation, you set the \n",
    "ground rules of a random process and then the computer uses random numbers to \n",
